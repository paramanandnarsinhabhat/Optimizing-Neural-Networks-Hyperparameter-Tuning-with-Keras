### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries and Functions
- Import essential libraries and functions, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Keras, and scikit-learn.

### Step 2: Reading the CSV File
- Read the dataset CSV file containing information about the images and their corresponding labels.

### Step 3: Load Images and Store in a Numpy Array
- Load images from the specified directory path and store them in a Numpy array.
- Iterate through each image, load it using its name, and append it to the Numpy array.

### Step 4: Storing the Target Variable
- Store the target variable (labels) in a separate variable, typically named 'y'.

### Step 5: Pre-processing the Data
- Convert the 3-dimensional images into 1-dimensional format.
- Normalize the pixel values of the images to a range between 0 and 1.

### Step 6: Creating Training and Validation Sets
- Split the dataset into training and validation sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn.

### Step 7: Defining the Model Architecture
- Create a Sequential model using Keras.
- Define the architecture of the neural network, including input layer, hidden layers, and output layer.

### Step 8: Compiling the Model
- Compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metric.

### Step 9: Training the Model
- Train the model on the training data using the `fit` method. Specify the number of epochs and batch size.

### Step 10: Evaluating Model Performance
- Get predictions from the model, both as class labels and probabilities.
- Calculate the accuracy of the model on the validation set.
- Visualize the loss and accuracy during training using Matplotlib.

### Step 11: Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)
- Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve the model's performance. This includes changing activation functions, increasing hidden layers, increasing epochs, and changing the optimizer.
- After making changes, recompile and retrain the model, then evaluate its performance.
